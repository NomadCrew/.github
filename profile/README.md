NomadCrew is an open-source group travel coordination platform that combines real-time location sharing, expense tracking, and travel planning into a single, cohesive mobile application.

## Project Vision
Traveling with friends should be about making memories, not managing apps. NomadCrew eliminates the need to switch between multiple applications for group coordination, expense splitting, and location sharing.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Location Sharing**: Keep track of group members with live location updates
- **Expense Management**: Split and track group expenses with ease
- **Group Communication**: Integrated chat and media sharing
- **Trip Planning**: Collaborative travel planning and itinerary management

## Architecture
NomadCrew follows a microservices architecture using modern cloud-native technologies:

- **Backend**: Go (Golang)
- **Frontend**: React Native
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Cache**: Redis
- **Message Queue**: Apache Kafka
- **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes
